Previously roles on Spoke included 'Admin', 'Texter', and 'Owner'. We currently want to shift application permissions to reflect the following user stories

1) Organization Administrator - This user can view all campaigns and have access to upload contacts, create campaigns, organizations and download reports
2) Campaign Admin - This user (super texter/trusted volunteer) has the ability to create a campaign and be over individual campaigns assigned to them (by org admin)
3) Texter - This user can only see their todos for their assigned campaigns
